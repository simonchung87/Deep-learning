# Deep-learning
These are the deep learning projects I've worked on:

- Flower Images Classification (Self-defined Neural Netwrok Structure)
- Fashion Clothes Classification (Multi-task Learning with Resnet)
- Tweet Sentiments Classification (roBERTa)
- Celebrities Face Generation (Generative Adversarial Network)
- Tuning with Metaheuristic Algorithm in the Application of Music Recognition (Particle Swamp Optimization with VGG and Resnet)
- Map Images Classification (Resnet)
